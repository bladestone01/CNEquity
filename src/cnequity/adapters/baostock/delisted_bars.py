"""Daily bars for stocks that have since delisted — the survivorship repair.

`instruments` is a current-roster snapshot, so a stock that delisted in 2019 is
absent from it and has no bars in the lake at all. Not a few missing days: the
whole symbol is gone. Measured against baostock's historical rosters, the lake
holds 83.2% of the stocks that actually traded on 2016-06-30, 94.0% on
2020-06-30, and 99.6% on 2026-06-30 — a clean survivorship curve, and the reason
CLAUDE.md marks the 2020–24 research window `incomplete` and every return and IC
measured on it biased upward.

The live vendors cannot fix this: 同花顺 returns empty for every delisted code
tested, across exchanges and delisting years. baostock can, and serves each one
through to its final session (康得退 to 2021-05-31, 乐视退 to 2020-07-21). Sina
still publishes their adjustment factors, so the recovered bars go through the
same hfq derivation as everything else.

Unadjusted prices, as everywhere else in the lake (`adjustflag="3"`).

``volume`` is already in 股, the lake's unit, so it passes through unconverted:
``amount / close / volume`` has a median of 1.000 over the 374,888 curated
baostock rows. The TDX path reports 手 and multiplies by 100 — that difference
is real, not an inconsistency to iron out. See :mod:`cnequity.domain.units`.
