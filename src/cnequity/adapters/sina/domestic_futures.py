"""Sina domestic futures daily K-line — main-continuous contracts.

Why this replaced EastMoney's push2his for the daily path: push2his is
intermittently unreachable in a way nothing on this side controls. Measured
over one session, a burst of ten requests came back 200 with a full payload,
then the same request failed 0/12 both directly and through a mainland exit,
and was still failing after seven minutes of silence. TLS, certificate and
routing were all verified healthy throughout, so it is an application-layer
refusal at the vendor. `commodity_bars` was the only daily consumer of that
host, and it spent every run failing 15 contracts to write one row.

Sina serves the same series, deeper, from a host that answered every probe in
this project's source-health sweeps. Per contract it returns the entire history
in one call and the caller slices — same contract as ``global_futures``.

Coverage measured 2026-08: each contract reaches back to its own listing
(CU0/AL0 2005, TA0 2006, ZN0 2007, AU0 2008, RB0 2009, J0 2011, AG0 2012,
I0 2013, JM0 2013, HC0 2014, MA0 2014, NI0 2015, SC0 2018, LC0 2023).
