"""Frame helpers for the one polars behaviour this codebase keeps tripping on.

``pl.DataFrame()`` — no columns, no rows — is the ordinary "nothing to report"
value across the adapters and steps. Polars broadcasts a literal expression
against a **zero-column** frame to length one, so::

    pl.DataFrame().with_columns(pl.lit(None).alias("source"))   # -> 1 row!

That is not the same as a zero-*row* frame that has a schema, which behaves as
expected and keeps zero rows. The difference is invisible at the call site and
the resulting row is quietly destructive: it carries whatever literals were
being stamped and nothing else, so it has no primary key. A strict
``validate_dataframe`` rejects it — but a ``pl.concat(..., how="diagonal_*")``
with a real day's rows runs first in several paths, fills its missing keys with
nulls, and launders it into the lake.

Found in ``step_trading_status`` (2026-08-30), where a session whose vendor
universe was empty produced a row with no symbol and no ``trade_date``, which
then failed the *next* day's date validation and pointed at the wrong session.

Use :func:`with_columns_unless_blank` wherever the frame being stamped can be
the untyped empty value. Where a frame is built with an explicit schema, plain
``with_columns`` is fine and clearer.
