"""Guards that keep the TDX client free of its former upstreams.

The wire protocol is vendored under ``adapters/tdx_protocol/_wire`` precisely so
that mootdx and tdxpy — both last released in 2024, both unmaintained — are no
longer installed. A stray ``import mootdx`` would still pass on a developer
machine that happens to have it left over, and only fail once a user installs
into a clean environment. These tests turn that into a CI failure instead.
