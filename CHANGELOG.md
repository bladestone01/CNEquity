## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `pip install ashare-lake` is the whole install. Every runtime source — AkShare,
  Baostock, SnowNLP, and the pandas/openpyxl/xlrd trio that parses the Shenwan
  and CNI constituent spreadsheets — is a hard dependency, so no daily or
  backfill step can silently lose a source because an extra was forgotten. Costs
  roughly 217MB over the previous minimal install.
- TDX quotes now use a vendored wire client (`adapters/tdx_protocol/_wire`,
  derived from tdxpy, MIT) instead of `mootdx`. Both `mootdx` and `tdxpy` were
  last released in 2024 and are unmaintained. Verified byte-identical to the
  previous implementation against live servers, including the full 51478-row
  security list.
- `httpx` is no longer capped at `<0.26`; that ceiling came from `mootdx`.
  Installs now resolve to 0.28.x.
- The bundled fallback TDX host list is now maintained in-tree
  (`adapters/tdx_protocol/hosts.py`). A probe of all 49 known hosts found every
  one of mootdx's 38 dead; the four that serve real bars are ordered first.
  Server selection went from failing across 16 probes to resolving in ~3s.

### Added

- `asl doctor` — checks what `asl config validate` deliberately cannot, since
  that command is environment-blind: whether `data.root` is absolute, present and
  writable, and whether every declared dependency actually imports. `--fix`
  repairs the `py_mini_racer` distribution collision cross-platform.
- Guards (`tests/unit/test_tdx_decoupling.py`) that fail the build if `mootdx`,
  `tdxpy` or the racer packages are imported or re-declared as dependencies.

### Fixed

- `bars()` now honours the market derived from the exchange suffix. `mootdx`
  had no such parameter, so the value this project computed was silently
  discarded and re-derived from the code prefix.

### Removed

- All extras (`tdx`, `macro`, `nlp`, `valuation`, `structure`, `all`).
  `pip install "ashare-lake[tdx]"` from an older doc still installs correctly:
  pip warns that the extra is not provided and continues, uv says nothing.
- Contributor tooling moved from the `dev` extra to a PEP 735 dependency group:
  `pip install -e . --group dev` (pip >= 25.1) or `uv sync`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- `asl config init` writes the packaged example TOML (no repo checkout needed);
  forces `orchestrator.workers = 1` on macOS
- Packaged template at `ashare_lake.config.templates` (kept in sync with
  `configs/ashare-lake.example.toml`)

### Fixed

- PyPI project page: ship a short Chinese `README.pypi.md` with absolute GitHub
  links (full `README.md` relative paths break on pypi.org)

### Changed

- Document `pip install "ashare-lake[tdx]"` as the primary install path
- `pyproject.toml` `readme` points at `README.pypi.md` instead of `README.md`
- Getting-started docs use `asl config init` instead of `git clone` + `cp`;
  quickstart separates one-minute demo from full-market init

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-19

First public release of the self-hosted A-share Parquet data layer.

### Added

- Multi-source ingest (TDX/mootdx, EastMoney, Sina, CNINFO, optional Baostock/AkShare)
  into a staged → curated → derived lake layout
- CLI (`asl`) for `init`, `run daily`, `backfill`, `compact`, `derive`, `audit`,
  `status`, `retry`, `query`, `catalog`
- Python `load()` API with `adjust` / `universe` / point-in-time `as_of`
- DuckDB views over curated Parquet
- Dataset coverage across reference, bars, corporate actions, fundamentals,
  capital flow, sector/industry structure, macro, news/sentiment, and risk events
- Quality audit (PK, mock-source guard, adj-factor reconciliation, cross-checks)
- Optional extras: `tdx`, `valuation`, `macro`, `nlp`, `structure`, `dev`
- Ops scripts for daily pipeline, health notify, and meta backup
- Docs: comparison vs AkShare/Tushare/Baostock, legal notes, schema contract,
  per-source limits, runbook

### Security / hygiene

- Ignore runtime logs and local tool/editor dirs
- TLS verify on by default for HTTP clients
- Project URLs point at `rootSunc/ashare-lake`
