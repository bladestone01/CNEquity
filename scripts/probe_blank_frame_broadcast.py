"""pytest plugin: report any code that stamps a column-less frame into a row.

`pl.DataFrame()` — no columns, no rows — is the codebase's "nothing to report"
value, and polars broadcasts a literal against it to length one. The fabricated
row carries only the literals, so it has no primary key; a strict validate
rejects it, but a diagonal concat with real rows fills its keys with nulls
first and launders it into the lake. `cnequity.domain.frames` explains it in
full; `tests/unit/test_blank_frame_broadcast.py` pins the guards.

This is the sweep that finds *new* occurrences. It wraps `DataFrame.with_columns`
and `DataFrame.select`, records every call that turned zero columns into one or
more rows, and writes the deduplicated stack traces at the end of the session::

    PYTHONPATH=scripts .venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/unit -q \
        -p probe_blank_frame_broadcast

`scripts/` is not a package, hence the PYTHONPATH. Two kinds of hit
are expected and not defects: the tests in
`tests/unit/test_blank_frame_broadcast.py` that demonstrate the behaviour on
purpose, and polars' own `_expand_dict_values`, which builds every
`pl.DataFrame({...})` this way. Anything under `src/cnequity/` is a defect.
